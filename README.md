# Dynare Steady State Toolbox

This toolbox provides a set of matlab routines that translate a matlab
routine computing the steady state of a DSGE model into something readable
by dynare (i.e. conforming to what is expected in a `*_steadystate2.m` file
generated by Dynare). An example is provided in the tests subfolder.
