# Dynare Steady State Toolbox

This toolbox provides a set of matlab routines that translate a matlab
routine computing the steady state of a DSGE model into something
readable by dynare (i.e. conforming to what is expected in a
`*_steadystate2.m` file generated by Dynare from the equations in the
`steady_state_model` model block). Examples are provided in the tests
subfolder. Assuming that the `dynare/matlab` folder is in the
Matab/Octave's path, you just need to add the `src` subfolder in the
path:

```matlab
>> addpath TOOLBOXES_PATH/dynare-steadystate-toolbox/src
```

where `TOOLBOXES_PATH` is the path to the folder where you unziped the
steadystate toolbox.

Compared to what Dynare does with the `steady_state_model`, this
toolbox is far less efficient than Dynare in producing the
`*_steadystate2.m` routine. The advantage is the additional
flexibility. The user can use any matlab statement in the source file
(loops, conditional structures, fixed point routines), add traps
and/or return custom error flags. Note that the routine produced by
this toolbox is as efficient as the one produced by Dynare from the
`steady_state_model` block (only the generation of the
`*_steadystate2.m` is slower, because this is done in Matlab/Octave
rather than by the C++ preprocessor).
